# Fortytwo Fortify portal for Microsoft 365

## Intro

[More commercial information can be read here](https://www.fortytwo.io/fortify)

A solution that monitors your Microsoft 365 configuration and compares it to best practices.

In an ever-evolving landscape of threats, making sure your Microsoft 365 environment is as secure as possible while also maintaining usability is difficult.

Introducing Fortytwo Fortify Portal for Microsoft 365, a solution that continuously monitors your Microsoft 365 configuration and compares it to best practices.

All your Microsoft 365 configuration with possible improvements will be reported with an explanation of why we check for this, an explanation on the consequence of following that best practice is, and a detailed guide on how to configure your environment in a best practice manner.

## What does this solution solve?

We see a lot of customers that are managing their own Microsoft 365 tenant â€“ which is great. However, many of these customers only have knowledge about 20 to 40 percent of Microsoft 365, while the rest is running happily on default settings. This might have been good enough up until now, but with threat actors setting their eyes on Microsoft 365, a 100% coverage is necessary.

## Azure Marketplace

The portal is available through [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/amestofortytwoas1653635920536.securityposture-2023?tab=Overview)
