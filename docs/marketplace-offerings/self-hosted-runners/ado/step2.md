# Step 2 - Configuring the Azure DevOps Agent Pool

Now the the VMSS is up and running, we are ready to configure the Azure DevOps side of things. 

On the organization level (not while in a project), go to **Organization settings**

Find **Agent pools** and click **Add pools**

Find you VMSS and name your pool:

Configure your preferred **Pool options**. We recommend having at least 1 agent on standby, though if cost is an issue, you can set it to 0 (you will have longer wait times for your first run due to provisioning the instance)
