## Overview

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its reliability and scalability. It collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e., data points with timestamp information attached. In an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, Prometheus works by scraping metrics from configured endpoints at specified intervals. These endpoints are usually exposed by Kubernetes components and workloads running within the cluster.

Once Prometheus collects these metrics, it can process them through its powerful querying language, PromQL, allowing for detailed insights and analysis. This data can then be forwarded to visualization tools like Grafana.
